  <h2>Python</h2>
  <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
  <p>Simple is better than complex.</p>
  <p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>
  <p>Flat is better than nested.</p>
  <p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>
  <p>Readability counts.</p>
  <p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</p>
  <p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>
  <p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
  <p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>
  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
  <p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
  <p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</p>
  <p>Now is better than never.</p>
  <p>Although never is often better than *right* now.</p>
  <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</p>
  <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
  <p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>

<section>
  <h2>Know which version you are using</h2>
  <p>2.7 on most of the machines. still some 2.6</p>
  <p>some minor changes even within 2.7</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<code>pip install celery</code>(amqp==2.0.3) will not work on &lt;2.7.7</p>
  <p class="segmented">and we are embracing <span style="color: red;">Python 3</span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Know which version you are using</h2>
  <p><code>2to3</code> will help a lot basically</p>
  <p>and check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">Python doc</a> before migration</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a> for managing and switching Python versions</p>
  <p>make sure your global version is still "system" to ensure libraries to work</p>
  <p>combine with virtualenv to make development env more isolated</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Follow PEP 8 style guide</h2>
  <p>For Vim, <code>Plugin 'klen/python-mode'</code> into your vimrc</p>
  <p>For Sublime, "Anaconda"</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use list comprehension over map &amp; filer</h2>
  <p>Faster</p>
  <p>More Pythonic</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Generator for large comprehensions</h2>
  <p>More memory friendly</p>
  <p><code>yield</code> is more than generator though: I will cover this in later section when I touch concurrency</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Careful use of <code>else</code></h2>
  <p>Really great with <code>try</code></p>
  <p>May take some time when with <code>for</code> or <code>while</code></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Pay attention to <code>finally</code></h2>
  <p>Supposed to do cleanup work</p>
  <p>control clause like <code>return</code> or <code>break</code> will silence any exceptions in the try-block</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use zip for loop iterators together</h2>
</section>
