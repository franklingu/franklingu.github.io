Well, clearly this article took me three months to complete–and I still do not really want to finish this if the new exam result release just arrived. So now I am writing about sem2 at the end of sem3(LOL). Does that mean that I am so busy in the last semester that I do not even have time for just an article? I would sem2 is just too bad that I do not even want to face it even after a whole semester.

K. Enough of that–we have to move on as time goes by.

 

MA1506:

This is not a module I like. I certainly understand the importance of mathematics but the kind of mathematics taught in this module does not count in my belief. Anyway, it is my core module and there is just no way that I can escape from it. The lecture is good and the tutor is particularly good–patient and cute, only reason that I was still studying that module probably, LOL.

Grade: A-

No comment on this but I am done with math for my university life.

Second time Lifeng is teaching us and another semester enjoying less load in programming thanks to Lifeng’s idea that ‘CEG students are not like CS students’. But the I put a lot of hard work in the project and resulted in better understanding of a lot of new stuff. The only regret was that I did not collaborate well with 3 others and kind of did that all by myself. Thus, I do not blame others that I did not get a good grade for another mod.

Grade: A+

This module does not exist any longer and thus no year one CEG students just enjoy those project experience.

 

CG1108:

EE module and what it requires is just carefulness, well, something that I am not good at.

Grade: A-

Press your calculator as well as possible.

 

CG1413:

Communication module and very important. Just that I do not think I benefit that much. But on the other hand, no tutor can just teach us those soft skills over night. In a sense, I am still taking this module as I am still not good at this aspect. No wonder I did not get good grade–another reason, English is also a problem, implicitly and explicitly.

Grade: B

Communication and team work!!!

 

ACC1102X:

Boring but useful. Easy but requires lots of carefulness.

Grade: A-

Understanding accounting is really gonna be useful in my future life I believe but it cost 300+ G points.

 

BSP1105:

No comment. Just like microeconomics.

Grade: B

I still do not get why the hell I got only B for this module!!!

 

There goes my year 1–if I had another chance, I will try to learn more and learn better.
