> PHP is the best language.  -- Annoymous

To be honest, I am still not very sure when some programmer tells me that "PHP is the best language" whether he is serious or just making fun. But anyway since I learned about programming, I did not have a chance of working with PHP seriously and recently I got assigned to set up my company's forum using a very new Forum system developed via PHP -- [Flarum](http://flarum.org/)
