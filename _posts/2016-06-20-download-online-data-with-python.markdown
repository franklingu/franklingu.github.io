Post in progress.

Python as a very convenient and powerful scripting language, is used allowed with scraping related data. One particular example of scraping would be downloading data. Let's say we already have format of destination links and what we need to do is just to save those online data locally in files or in a database. There are quite some ways to achieve it but each is going to fit for its own purpose.

Mainly there are the following ways:

1. requests

2. wget

3. mechanize

4. selenium

TBC.
