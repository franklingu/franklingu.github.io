Recently I have to reading about how memory management is done in Rust. And here are some recommended posts from me:
1. (Overview of memory management in Rust)[http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2013/03/18/an-overview-of-memory-management-in-rust/]
2. (Rust book)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/the-stack-and-the-heap.html]
