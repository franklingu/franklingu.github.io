Before starting reading this post, maybe it is a good idea if you can watch this entire TED talk by yourself first [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfBpsV1Hwqs&list=PLAC463A2B6B2CEC7F)

I have always had this belief that playing game is just of waste of time, same as what most other people are thinking according to the speaker. But then the question is, if playing game is waste of time, what is not waste of time? Reading some books--what sort of book? Do a bit more coding--as I am about to become a programmer? Talk/play with my friends/families? Well, these things sound "meaningful" to me, but what is the meaning that I am seeking? What is supposed to be the ultimate purpose? I do not usually want to continue question  myself this way cause this philosophical question about meaning of life is so profound that I guess after so many years with so much hard work from brilliant minds, we are still not very sure about the definite answer to this question.

Speaking of life purpose, let's look at death cause death, the opposite of life may give us some clue on what should have been done during "life".

The top 5 regrets of dying people:

1. I wished I had not worked so hard.

2. I wished I had stayed in touch with my friends.

3. I wished I had let myself be happier.

4. I wished I had courage to express the true self

5. I wished I had lived true to my dreams, instead of what others expected of me.

So these 5 regrets basically represent the deep desires of humanity: happiness, fun, relationships.

And a "role-playing" game was come up by the speaker to conqurer her anxiety and sickness after an accident that causes a damage to her brain--supperbetter.

The game play basically goes like this:

1. Stand up and take 3 steps | make your hands into fists, raise them over your head, as high as you can for 5 seconds. -- physical resilience

2. Snap your finder exactly 50 times | count backwards from 100 by 7. -- mental resilience

3. Inside a room, find a window and look outsides; outside a room, find a window and look inside | search "baby [favorite animal]" online -- emotional resilience

4. Shake someone's hand for 6 seconods | send someone a thank-you by sms, FB or twitter. -- social resilience

After I was enrolled in Computer Engineering NUS, I gradually changed to a person with fewer words, spending less time socializing and exercising less. Although deep inside I know it is not going to do more bad than good if I continue live a life like this, I am not motivated enough to get out of my room, working out or socializing. This TED talk is just another remainder to me that I need to lead a healthier life--emotionally, mentally, pysically and socially.

And I personally belief is that the key to **a healthier life** is to keep a balance of all perspetives. Spend some time talking with friends my families, learn something new/read some book about development, get some exercise, play some games(with friends or families better)--2000 years ago several famous Chinese philosophers are talking about the importance of having of balance--not just applicable to personal life, but also to the planet, to the whole universe. Of course I am not trying to talk about profound quesitons like that but the point here is that get just enough of enough for everyday life.
