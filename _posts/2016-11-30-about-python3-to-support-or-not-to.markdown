meta_desc: my thoughts on recently a very hot discussion about The Case Against Python 3
---

Python 3 has been out for quite a long time and because of various reasons, mainly the decision of non-backward-compatability, the migration process is still slower than expected. Python 2 is very easy to use and great to work with already and all of sudden the community is saying that we have several great ideas to improve Python 2 and all of existing Python programmers need to rework on their skills. As a Python programmer myself, honestly I am not happy about this--and I do not think any Python programmers are happy about old code just break and will not run at all--because we are programmers and we are human, we do not like changes and we like things to be stable so that we are still in our old comfort zone.

But, is Python 3 not worth the migration at all? Or is Python 3 just so bad that it is going to ruin the Python language? I am no expert in language design and implementation--yet I would claim that Python 3 is the future, although we know it is not perfect, and it will never be, but we know it is better.

So all of this discussion started from this article [The Case Against Python 3](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html), by Zed Shaw, the author of a very famous book [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). I did not read this book cover to cover but with a few glances, I believe it is a good book to people who first enter Python and programming world. I fully respect and admire his effort and creation in this book. And recently some people wants to remove this book from reddit's recommended Python books unless the author upgrades code samples in the book to Python 3. Therefore we have this article and there is a heated discussion in the community thereafter.
