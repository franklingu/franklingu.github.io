In 2015, I am becoming a fourth-year student in National University of Singapore. Along with graduation comes near the job hunting, during which I have learned some valuable lessons in *stepping into the society*(zou xiang she hui as in Chinese, which basically means that after 16 years of simple school life, one finally gets the opportunity to meet more kinds of people and experience all sorts of complexities emotionally and intellectually). Throughout the year, I have been trying to read more books to enrich my knowledge and understanding. Besides books, I also want to talk about movies as I have watched some good or just-so-so movies as entertainment.

##### Reading list

* **The mythical man-month**<br>
  Pretty old book but some ideas still hold true even in today's context. Emphasis on communication and ideas on development tools are among the good points I see in this book. I guess most people who have heard of it know this is just a very classic book on project management yet few bother to read it because either it is just too old or we are too busy. However, I would claim that classic hardly dies away and the core philosophy in the book just lasts until now and days to come.<br>
  Recommendation: A great book. A must-read for programmers.

* **The well-grounded rubyist**<br>
  This is a rather technical book and it is an introductory book on the Ruby programming language. Many concepts in Ruby are covered and explained in details. The book is well organized as well for understanding. Unlike most introductory books, it does not focus too much on tiny details of syntax but instead it is good at explaining why things are designed in this way and introducing some good practices.<br>
  Recommendation: A good book and people who are starting Ruby programming really should read it.

* **The passionate programmer**<br>
