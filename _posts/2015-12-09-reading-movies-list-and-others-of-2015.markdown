---

In 2015, I am becoming a fourth-year student in National University of Singapore. Along with graduation comes near the job hunting, during which I have learned some valuable lessons in *stepping into the society*(zou xiang she hui as in Chinese, which basically means that after 16 years of simple school life, one finally gets the opportunity to meet more kinds of people and experience all sorts of complexities emotionally and intellectually). Throughout the year, I have been trying to read more books to enrich my knowledge and understanding. Besides books, I also want to talk about movies as I have watched some good or just-so-so movies as entertainment.

##### Reading list

* **The mythical man-month**<br>
  Pretty old book but some ideas still hold true even in today's context. Emphasis on communication and ideas on development tools are among the good points I see in this book. I guess most people who have heard of it know this is just a very classic book on project management yet few bother to read it because either it is just too old or we are too busy. However, I would claim that classic hardly dies away and the core philosophy in the book just lasts until now and days to come.<br>
  Recommendation: A great book. A must-read for programmers despite of its age.

* **The well-grounded rubyist**<br>
  This is a rather technical book and it is an introductory book on the Ruby programming language. Many concepts in Ruby are covered and explained in details. The book is well organized as well for understanding. Unlike most introductory books, it does not focus too much on tiny details of syntax but instead it is good at explaining why things are designed in this way and introducing some good practices.<br>
  Recommendation: A good book and people who are starting Ruby programming really should read it.

* **The passionate programmer**<br>
  This is not a book about how to be good at some fields of programming but it is focused on how to be a good or even great programmer in a generic way. Surely it is very important that we should learn about some technology and master it so that we can make a living and even a fame. We should first consider which technology to dive into, and what happens if this technology is not "hot" anymore. Other than software development skills, should we learn about and take into consideration the business cycle--after all, it is business(application of programming) that gives us money instead of 10,000 lines of code you wrote. Not saying that code is completely useless with business but we should really think for business and even think of our career as business. Maybe as software developers ourselves, we may not agree with the author on all ideas and time may prove some are not appropriate anymore. We could still get some inspirations from this book and become a passionate and good programmer.
  Recommendation: A good book on how to be a passionate programmer.

* **God and new physics (shang di yu xin wu li xue)**<br>
  Well, as a fan of science I have curiosity about many philosophical questions like is there really a god, is there really soul, what is spirit? I am not religious but I studied bible for some time. So things I learn from physics and bible sort of contradict and therefore I want to find what is truth of the big bang, singlelarity and life. Without taking post-graduate courses in physics or philosophy, I am guided by a famous physicist (...) through the discussions of many profound questions. The author is not trying to present or persuade any "right answer" to readers. Instead, he is merely talking about what we know as of now, what we used to believe, what we are suspecting now. So I did not know whether there is a god or not by reading this book but I know more evidence and thought deeper about this question. A worth mentioning method brought up in the book is (huan yuan lun)--instead of taking the subject apart and see how those little parts fit together, we should take a holistic approach in analyzing. This is especially true when it comes to mind and "spirit" as single cell does not have any sign of thinking, yet a human being is capable of thinking and reasoning. In my opinion the collective intelligence works in a similar way--one single honey bee may not have any sign of intelligence yet all as a whole is able to make smart decisions without central control in any sense.
