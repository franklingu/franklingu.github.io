Today I just finished Google Grow Beyond Program.

(This is the first time for me to in fact to write something on a blog but I want to give it a try since I really want to preserve this kind of experience. I was keeping myself a diary for 6 years but not any more since I came Singapore for University. My first year’s life is a little bit off track because I was like gaming and watching a lot of movies. So this summer vocation I really took some time to think about what I am going to do in the near future and some other serious problems concerning with my life. And that is why I joined this program to enhance myself as an individual as well as a potential programmer. )

So the first day I had in Google Singapore was a Saturday–We are having some training as well as some practice in self-awareness, “personal color”(in this case, I am an orange who is generally pursuing speed and results.) and “6 thinking hats”. Basically we have some games and some discussions. It was a time of fun and I just thought it was too short.

(I am not supposed to say more about it since the manager in fact wants us to keep this a secret so more students who are joining will also find it fun. I hope my post is not ruining your fun in this program if you are going to join this.)

So then today we have one more workshop on technical guide for a programmer and skills about presentations. Basically there are training and actual presentations. Although I would say English is still a barrier to me if it comes to presentation, generally I am really happy about how my presentation went. There are also other surprises about Python as well as how to get a job in high-tech company like Google, FB, Tweeter or Amazon. And then we had a nice dinner to celebrate.

It is just something in my dream to be able to see Google and be able to work in Google. What is the good news is that Google Singapore is comparatively large. But the bad news is that it is mainly on sales and market. Well, I think that is fine. I will work hard to get in it. But it does not matter if in the end I did not get an opportunity for Google Sg–I will still be armed with strong skills that will prepare me for a better career and a better future.

It is a joyful two days in Google, in the workshop. It is something like a fresh start at the beginning of my second year in NUS. It is just like the way Davidson Young put it, “We do not talk about the past since there is nothing we can do about it. We look at the future and will do everything we can to make it better.”–The past year 1 is there already and I cannot do anything to change it basically, but there is still a not short time for me to catch with my plan and schedule–and also catch up with my peers.
