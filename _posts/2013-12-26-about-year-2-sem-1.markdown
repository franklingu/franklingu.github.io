After a not very good year 1 in NUS, I decided to have a change. And the start of the this semester was already different–I decided to take 7 modules. If the Orbital Programme–CP3108 in the summer also counts, 8 in total and those include intensive modules like CS2103 and EG2301. But I wanted to give it a shoot.

 

So here come the 8 modules:

CG2271:

By the time I took this module, it is not as horrible as before and in fact that is why I was able to manage all 8 modules. Well, it turns out that the stuff is shifted to another module and now the workload for this module is within limit now. The lecturer–now and probably in the next few years too, is Colin Tan. He is a nice guy but I cannot get most of his jokes, LOL. Operating system is really complicated and this module only covers some basic real time operating system principles. This is different from CS2106 because that module focuses more on file system but this module deals with memory more. Anyway, you do not expect a real time operating system to have large-size hard drive.

Grade: A-(I was hoping A, though)

No additional comment.

 

CS2010:

A must-take module if you want to be a CS-CEG guy. Taught by Steven Halim, this module in sem1 is usually more difficult than that in sem2. Graph, just graph theory. So, learn CS1231 well.

Grade: A+

Take this in sem 1!

 

CS2102:

Uh, just took it for the 4 MCs because DB is really boring if the module is just about DB SQL syntax and some useless relation calculus. Relation algebra is OK as it can reflect the thinking process. The most useful stuff is probably DB design but now it seems with the help of Django/Rails, dealing with objects rather than tables is more pleasant.

Grade: A+

Do not take it unless you want to take SQL as serious part of your programming life.

 

CS2103:

Different people generally have different opinions towards this module but most of them would agree this is a useful one. Just a glimpse of software engineering in the industry last for 11 lectures but you have to learn about much more stuff taught in lectures to get a deep understanding.

Grade: A+

Feeling great because in this module I think my team functioned well. Way to become a good team player for me.

 

EE2020:

A not good lecturer in the first half and an OK lecturer in the second half. I did not do well for the final but I believe the reason for not grading well for that module is more likely to be not taking assignments seriously.

Grade: A-

Do assignments better.

 

EE2021:

Fundamental stuff in EE. Many formulas are involved in this module and that is why I do not like this.

Grade: A-

Work with formulas better.

 

EG2301:

In fact I am not sure I really learned from this module. Just the presentation and the report is the stuff I remembered about this module.

Grade: A-(this is really good in my opinion)

Drop out of DCP now.

 

CP3108:

Fun module, must take!

 

OK. Next semester I am going to take CS3217 and I am prepared somehow because I have taken 7 modules this sem.
