  <h2>Python</h2>
  <pre>
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

    <h2>Python -- Multi-Paradigms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For many data science and system administration work: procedural</li>
      <li>For complicated data structure: class based object oriented</li>
      <li>For some computation work and decorator: functional</li>
      <li>Functional: great for tricks and hacks, not largely supported</li>

      <li>Classes for complicated data and their behavior</li>

class FirstClass:
    """Our first class: just a simple demo

    A class is a namespace by itself. When seeing the class keyword,
    a class definition begins. And when the indentation ends, the class
    definition ends and a class object is created.
    So a new class is an object--similar to Ruby and you can create a
    class from metaclass just like you are about to create an object
    from a class. This sounds confusing? Just bear with me for a while.

    <h2>A bit too much--some explanation now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A namespace is just a box. Many names are in it.</li>
      <li>Names in a namespace are not visible to outside of the box</li>
      <li>A class is a namespace--therefore you cannot see names inside it</li>
      <li>But of course you may refer to names inside it by referring to the box first</li>
