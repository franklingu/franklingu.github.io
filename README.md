### Introduction
This is a personal blog for [franklingu](mailto:franklingujunchao@gmail.com) for keeping notes of thoughts on programming(Python, Ruby, iOS, Linux or anything that I came across or read about) or life in general. You can visit it at [franklingu.github.io](http://franklingu.github.io/).

### About Me
I am currently a developer in a hedge fund, mainly working with data and providing development support to researchers and quant developers. Personally I like reading and learning about new technologies -- so normally I would read about different fields, Python, dev-ops, Scala, Java, JavaScript, big data. So now I am thinking about diving into some field, for example Python, Spark and studying into greater details.

As hobbies I like reading books about history, psychology, sci-fi fictions, swimming, and playing MOBA.
