### Introduction
This is a personal blog for [franklingu](mailto:franklingujunchao@gmail.com) for keeping notes of thoughts on programming(Python, Ruby, iOS, Linux or anything that I came across or read about) or life in general. You can visit it [here](http://franklingu.github.io/).

### About Me
I am currently a developer in a hedge fund, mainly working with data and provide development support to researchers and quant developers. I am currently learning in depth about Python, Linux administration. I am also learning Scala and data analysis as well as personal interests.
