Python is elegant and expressive and there is not much needed to prove this. Simply open up a terminal and get started with its English-like syntax and solve hard and tricky problems in shorter and more beautiful code. I have been learning and using Python for quite some time and find that I need to know more in-depth knowledge. A lot of the time I just find the language so easy to use that I may just stop there without ever digging into it. By thinking about how to further improve it, in terms of extensibility or performance, I am pushing myself to become a better Pythonic programmer.

So recently I started reading this book (编写高质量代码：改善Python程序的91个建议)[https://book.douban.com/subject/25910544/]. It is written in Chinese -- Python is also very popular in China and there are quite a few good Python programmers there. Honestly this book share the same problem with most Chinese programming books, or programming books translated into Chinese: the author or translators are simply not careful enough -- quite a few code snippets contain typos. Another common problem, which can be found in this book as well, when Chinese authors make any direct or indirect references to other books, they do not provide links or notes to original text. (This is simply unimaginable in English publishing industry but it is improving gradually in China as well). For the first problem, when I was reading, I will just let go of those typos -- those typos do not really affect my understanding of the idea being illustrated as I know Python basics pretty well. As for the second problem, it is more about respect for the original author, though serious, does not affect reading much. However, I have to point out that this book tries to cover so much that it does not get deep into each topic, especially when it comes to hard topics like MRO, metaclass. Therefore, overall I think this book is worth reading, only that while reading, we just need to glance at the ideas and Google and dig deep into hard topics. So be quick while reading but be slow when studying some in-depth topics.

It composes of in total 8 parts:

1. introduction (about Pythonic and coding style in general)<br>
   This part is pretty subjective and personally I guess it can be just skipped. The target audience of this book should be able to get those basic ideas about Python easily. As for some suggestions about coding style, those are simply subjective and it depends on the teams requirements as well.

2. common practices (some common bad practices to avoid and good ways of achieving some goals)<br>
   

3. basic syntax (some powerful keywords to be used in different senarios)

4. libraries (recommendations of some libraries for some common tasks)

5. design patterns (implementation of some design patterns in Python for extensibility)

6. built-in mechanisms (dig deep into Python built-in methods)

7. tools in development cycle (some tools to ease Python development)

8. performance analysis and improvement.
